# Beyond Exponential
## Exploring Effective Alternative Feeding Strategies in Fed-Batch Fermentation

### About
This repository contains the code, models, data, and documentation for the thesis: **Beyond Exponential: Exploring Effective Alternative Feeding Strategies in Fed-Batch Fermentation**. 
This work focuses on analytically solving an ordinary differential equation (ODE) system of standard fed-batch processes with various feed rates. 
The repository includes a Mathematica notebook for modeling the ODE System of a fed-batch, analytically solving it, and creating and exporting data, as well as a Jupyter notebook for data analysis and visualization.

The repository contains the following files:

- **`FedBatchSolutions_AG.nb`**: Mathematica notebook for setting up the fed-batch model, solving it analytically, generating data, and exporting results.
- **`FedBatchSolutions_AG.pdf`**: PDF version of the Mathematica notebook, providing non-Mathematica users a view of the model setup and solutions.
- **`fedbatch_plotter.ipynb`**: Jupyter notebook for analyzing and plotting data exported from the Mathematica notebook.
- **`envi2.yml`**: Conda environment file for creating the required environment to run `fedbatch_plotter.ipynb`.
